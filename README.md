# Homework 7

Core of this homework is the same as the previous homework but there are a few differences.
first of all I define a datatype actually for the objects which has some attribute with their datatype and all of them are optional because the way i code the updatePerson function needed to be like that.

It is neccesary to explain something that I did to code in typescript:

I. Install the node.js to have npm 
II. Install the typescript globally with this command in terminal: npm i -g typescript
III. Then it is neccesary to initilize our project with tsc --init and we have to answer some questions to create the project identifier of ours
IV. Then create typescript file which here it is index.ts
V. Code in typescript
VI. And finally we need to convert typescript codes to javascript with this command: tsc (but we can use tsc -w to make it every single characters changed shown)
