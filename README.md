# Homework 4

In this Homework we have 3 different exercises.

The first one is about converting the tempreture in celsius to fahrenheit. I defined a function which is takes a input (celsius) and returns the fahrenheit. Its formula is (celsius * 9 /5) + 32. 
If all goes right then it prints a positive mesaage, otherwise a negative message.

The second one is about check the availability of the word into a sentence. print a positive message if it exists and otherwise a negavtive message. I use the includes function to check this.

And the last one is about creating an Object which has some feature. in this case it's about an iPhone. The features include name, brand and so on. plus 2 functions which there are just only their signature.
